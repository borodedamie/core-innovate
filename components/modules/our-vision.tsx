        <div className="text-base text-secondary font-medium space-y-6">
          <p>
            CoreInnovate was created with a simple but powerful mission: to
            bridge the gap between technology and business outcomes. Too often,
            organisations struggle with IT that is reactive, insecure, or
            misaligned with their goals. Our founder, Michael Folorunsho, saw
            first-hand how the right strategy and support could transform
            businesses â€” not just by fixing problems, but by preventing them and
            driving growth.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the start, CoreInnovate has been built on the belief that
            technology should empower people, protect organisations, and create
            long-term value. That vision continues to guide everything we do
            today.
